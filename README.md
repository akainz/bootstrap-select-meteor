Bootstrap-Select
================

Meteor packaging for [Bootstrap-Select](http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/), an enhancement for `<select>` inputs, with custom styling and icons, multiple selections, local autocomplete/filtering/live-search and size/width control. Doesn't support [tags mode input](https://github.com/silviomoreto/bootstrap-select/issues/565) - [use Select2](https://github.com/TimSchlechter/bootstrap-tagsinput/issues/123) for that.

If I forgot to upgrade to the latest version, please start a new issue
or notify me and I'll happily upgrade it for you. Or if you want
to be nice and save me a few seconds; fork it, make a PR and I'll merge it.
